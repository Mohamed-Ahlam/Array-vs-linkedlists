# Array-vs-linkedlists

I implemented a list in two different ways: as an ArrayList and as a LinkedList.
I then compared the time complexities of a select few List methods when implemented as an
ArrayList and as a LinkedList.

The List class contains descriptions of what each List methods should do.
